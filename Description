I worked with noise-contaminated raw data from various stock exchanges. The dataset included 
merged stock prices recorded at microsecond intervals across multiple exchanges. To address the 
noise and extract the true price signals for each stock, I applied Fourier transformation for noise filtering. 
Following this, I employed Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict stock prices accurately.

This project also illustrates the limitations of using naive regression methods, which often fail to capture 
the non-linear patterns in the data. It underscores the importance of adopting more robust models like Support 
Vector Regression to achieve more accurate and reliable predictions.
